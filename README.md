# Alice's Final Project for INST377

# Target browsers:
- Laptop sized devices
# Description of Project:
- I used the Dog Breeds API
- I used Google Tables for my project
- The table lets the user visualize the different dog breeds and how many sub breeds each dog breed has
- My project is trying to display the different dog breeds and it is trying to examine how common breeding between certain breeds is for dogs. A lot of dogs are a mix, but a lot of times they are not a healthy mix. This is a big problem because some breeds just shouldnâ€™t be mixed together because it can create problems in the future. 
# CSS Framework Used:
- I used the modern CSS framework
